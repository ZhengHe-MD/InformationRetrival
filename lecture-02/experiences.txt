It took approximately 12 hours to accomplish this exercise sheet. The most difficult and time-consuming part of the exercise was the program performance.

Firstly, we had problems with applying BM25 formula on hundreds of thousands of elements (later we found a good approach using caching in the preprocessing phase while reading the movies.txt file). Then we got stuck with calculating P@3, P@R and AP. But again, found the way out.

Unfortunately, we couldn't take movies popularity into the consideration as we don't know what to do and how to apply it to the resulting list with BM25 scores.

The exercise itself seems to be harder than the previous one.
